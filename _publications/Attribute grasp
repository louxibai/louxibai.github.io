title: "Attribute-Based Robotic Grasping with One-Grasp Adaptation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Attribute grasp
excerpt: 'We introduce an end-to-end learning method of attribute-based robotic grasping with one-grasp adaptation capability. Our approach fuses the embeddings of a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and learns to predict instance grasping affordances.'
