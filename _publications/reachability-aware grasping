collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1910.06404
excerpt: 'A voxel-based deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) that generates feasible 6-DoF grasp poses in unrestricted workspace with reachability awareness. The reachability predictor evaluates if the grasp pose is reachable by exploiting large-scale synthetic datasets.'
