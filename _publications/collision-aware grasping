title: "Collision-Aware Target-Driven Object Grasping in Constrained Environments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/collision-aware grasping
excerpt: 'Typical 6-DoF robotic grasping systems rely on the prior knowledge about the environment and intensive planning computation, which is ungeneralizable and inefficient. In contrast, we propose a novel Collision-Aware Reachability Predictor (CARP) for 6-DoF grasping systems, it learns to estimate the collision-free probabilities for grasp poses and significantly improves grasping in challenging environments.'
